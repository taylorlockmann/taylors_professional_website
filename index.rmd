I am a Masters candidate at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, specializing in Conservation Planning with an emphasis on data science. 
My passion is using scientific approaches to solve real-world problems, especially when it comes to using GIS and remote sensing to deepen understanding of natural disasters.
